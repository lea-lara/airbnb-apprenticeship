# demo for airbnb apprenticeship application 
Hello, This is a a demo my coding skills as part of my airbnb apprenticeship application. The repo contains 2 projects. 

One ('project 1' directory) is a simple project demonstrate the knowledge of basic programming comcepts, such as datatypes, loops, recursion, scope, variables, operators, and such; all expresed through HTML and JavaScript.  
The requirement for the task was to demonstate solving a problem with logic. The task demonstated involves collection user input and creating an output dynamically through the use of a JavaScript function. 
I chose these languages because I wanted to provide an example that would be a stand alone and fully executable, as the examples of the code I typically write are all part of bigger projects and thus do not run on their own. I am training to be a backend developer and typically focus on backend solutions, including server data management, however, as mentioned earlier, those solutions are part of bigger applications and will not be runnable as a separate little project. Nonetheless, I am adding a snippet of the code I wrote for a Controller on an ASP.NET MVC web application ('project 2' directory). Though it is not runnable, I added comments to elaborate on what that does.
